<h2><b>Introduction</b></h2>
<p>
  <b>PlugLightJS</b> is a simple javascript framework designed to build data-driven applications with a modular approach easily. Its architecture was inspired by an    existing framework called <b>ECSY.js</b> (link above); I decided to make my framework, to gain more control of some design aspects like event management and object construction and allocation.
</p>
<h2>Usage</h2>


```js

//  First, create a 'World' instance: the top-level class that controls the framework components

const world = new World()
```
